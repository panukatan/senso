# senso: An Interface to the Philippine Census of Population and Housing Data

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) makes census of population and
housing data publicly available through various data publications and
releases over time via their website. This package provides utilities
for accessing and processing the census of population and housing data
released by the PSA.

## What does `senso` do?

Please note that `senso` is still highly experimental and is undergoing
a lot of development. Hence, any functionalities described below and in
the rest of the package documentation have a high likelihood of changing
interface or approach as we aim for a stable working version.

Currently, the packageâ€™s main functionalities are:

- Retrieval and/or download of census of population and housing data for
  every census conducted released by the PSA on their website;

- Standardised naming of census of population and housing statistical
  table files;

- Upload and/or archive raw census of population and housing data
  releases onto specific platforms; and,

- Process raw census of population and housing data releases into
  machine-readable and relational database-ready structures.

## Installation

`senso` is not yet on CRAN but can be installed from the [panukatan R

``` r

  "senso",
  repos = c('https://panukatan.r-universe.dev', 'https://cloud.r-project.org')
